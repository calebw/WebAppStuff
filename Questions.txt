Heap and PermGen
Heap(Obj Mem) has generations:
 -Young, new
 -Tenured, long lived
 -Perm, permanent, classes
GC cleans both Young and Tenured

OutOfMemoryError can occur at different places:
Heap - whole mem space too small
Perm - Too many classes
Array - size larger than Heap

DAO has multiple implmentations.

Transaction has commit and roollback
Can set Isolation, rather it can or cannot see uncommitted writes by others.

Synchronized block in Java only allows 1 thread at a time.
ArrayList is non-sync and can be accessed by many threads.
